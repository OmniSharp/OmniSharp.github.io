1. Install the [OmniSharp-vim](https://github.com/OmniSharp/Omnisharp-vim) Vim/neovim plugin using your favourite method or plugin manager.
1. Optionally install a linting plugin ([ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) or [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)) and selector plugin ([fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim), [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) or [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)).
1. Create some [mappings](https://github.com/OmniSharp/Omnisharp-vim#configuration), or install [vim-sharpenup](https://github.com/nickspoons/vim-sharpenup) to get up and running quickly.
1. Open a .cs file in vim. OmniSharp-vim will ask permission to install the server - answer 'Y', wait for it to do its thing, and you're away!
