title: OmniSharp - .NET and IntelliSense on any platform with your editor of choice
layout: default

## Welcome to OmniSharp...for your editor!
![Look at all those editor icons!](images/icons.png?raw=true)

OmniSharp is a family of Open Source projects, each with one goal - To enable great .NET development in YOUR editor of choice.

It's fun to say Cross Platform .NET. But is it reasonable for someone to develop .NET without Visual Studio and Windows?

Is it fun to do .NET on a Mac in Sublime? Ubuntu and Emacs? Windows and Atom? You can use your editor PLUS get to use great features like Intellisense (not just Autocomplete), Add Reference, Format Document, and lots more. Develop anywhere, deploy anywhere (and to [Azure](http://www.azure.com)!)

### Yeoman generators

Getting started with projects is easy using [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Here are some generators that you
can use to get started.

#### ```generator-aspnet```

The goal of [```generator-aspnet```](https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-aspnet) is to provide an experience consistent with creating new ASP.NET 5 (_DNX_) projects
and files in Visual Studio 2015. Below are some other related generators that you may be interested in.

If you are working on a related generator please [open an issue](https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-aspnet/issues/new) to let us know about it so that we can add it to the list.
